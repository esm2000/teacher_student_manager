# Teacher-Student Manager 

This project is a school administration tool that allows the user to assign students to teachers and teachers to students. The tool is a CRUD application that is capable of creating teachers and students, reading information about existing teachers and students, update information about existing teachers and students, and delete information about teachers and students. The frontend of the application was made with React and the backend was handled by an Express NodeJS server.
